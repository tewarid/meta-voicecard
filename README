## Adding the meta-voicecard layer to your build

Run 'bitbake-layers add-layer meta-voicecard'

## Seeed Voicecard

To add Seeed voicecard support to your machine, add the following to `local.conf`

```conf
MACHINE_FEATURES += "seeed-voicecard"
IMAGE_INSTALL:append:rpi = " kernel-module-seeed-voicecard"
KERNEL_DEVICETREE:append:rpi = " \
overlays/seeed-2mic-voicecard.dtbo \
overlays/seeed-4mic-voicecard.dtbo \
overlays/seeed-8mic-voicecard.dtbo \
"
RPI_EXTRA_CONFIG:append = "\n\
dtoverlay=seeed-2mic-voicecard\n\
"
```

`RPI_EXTRA_CONFIG` is configured to enable [reSpeaker 2-Mics Pi HAT for Raspberry Pi](https://www.seeedstudio.com/ReSpeaker-2-Mics-Pi-HAT.html) by default, change appropriately.

On the device, you need to adjust volume and toggle some switches that are off by default

```bash
amixer -c1 sset 'Headphone',0 80%,80%
amixer -c1 sset 'Speaker',0 80%,80%
amixer -c1 sset 'Left Input Mixer Boost' toggle
amixer -c1 sset 'Left Output Mixer PCM' toggle
amixer -c1 sset 'Right Input Mixer Boost' toggle
amixer -c1 sset 'Right Output Mixer PCM' toggle
```
